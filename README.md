# Forest Fire Predictor

## Overview
This project aims to predict forest fires using machine learning algorithms. The prediction model is built using Python and the web interface is created using Django.

## Features
- Data Collection: Collects data related to forest fires such as weather conditions, geographical data, historical fire incidents, etc.
- Model Training: Uses machine learning algorithms to train a model that can predict forest fires based on the collected data.
- Web Interface: A user-friendly web interface that takes necessary inputs from the user, passes them to the trained model, and displays the prediction results.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/username/forest-fire-predictor.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd forest-fire-predictor`
3. Install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
